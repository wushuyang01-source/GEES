                    <h2>The Maritime Industry's Greatest Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Ships are highly customized products, but often the iteration of ship models can be one of the most challenging things of this century. This fundamental challenge has created a technological stagnation that perpetuates environmental and operational problems across global waterways.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is why you still see the same scene on the Huangpu River at the Bund, where inland bulk cargo ships continue to sail as they did thirty years ago, emitting black smoke and operating with outdated systems that harm both the environment and the economic prospects of vessel operators.</p>
